REMARKS

*Administrator Samantha Power at the Swearing-In Ceremony for Erik Janows=
ky, Mission Director for Morocco

**Ronald Reagan Building*

Thank you, Andy, for kicking us off. Good morning to everyone here in per=
son and those tuning in virtually. A special welcome to Erik=92s family =96=
 his mother Peggy; his brother and sister-in-law, Kurt and Jory; his sist=
er Brooke and her son, Serafino; and of course his wife, Gloria, and thei=
r son, Ian. I=92m told Erik=92s daughter, Bella, is also tuning in virtua=
lly from London, where she is studying to become a screenwriter.

Before we celebrate Erik and this tremendous achievement, I have to depar=
t from script to pay tribute to Gloria. I just learned that Gloria passed=
 her State Department Oral Exam and will be joining the Foreign Service. =
Ian put it best: =93I guess I have a lot to live up to.=94

Erik grew up in Indiana, in a family dedicated to service and giving back=
. His mother, Peggy, worked with underprivileged communities through Unit=
ed Way and then at the Notre Dame library. His father, Gordy, was a publi=
c school teacher who taught high school chemistry for over four decades. =
The family=92s focus on helping professions clearly influenced Erik, who =
is described by almost everyone he meets as someone who truly has a heart=
 for service, someone who, as his mother put it, constantly asks the ques=
tion: =93what can I do to help?=94

It=92s a quality that surfaced when Erik was quite young. His mother reme=
mbers him caring diligently for his baby sister Brooke, becoming, as she =
described, a kind of second father to her, and making her laugh with his =
renditions of the Beatles=92 =93Rocky Raccoon.=94 And when Peggy herself =
injured her back skating at the university ice rink on Christmas Eve, Eri=
k =96 then just in high school, found a doctor willing to help out on the=
 holiday, and for weeks cooked and brought her meals, while practically c=
arrying her to and from her bed.

It wasn=92t just his family who took notice of Erik=92s caring nature. In=
 college, Erik befriended the late Father Theodore Hesburgh, an internati=
onally recognized defender of human rights who at the time was the Presid=
ent of Notre Dame. The two became penpals when Erik joined the Peace Corp=
s in Ecuador, and Father Ted became one of Erik=92s closest mentors, alwa=
ys reminding him that =93one person can make a difference.=94 They were s=
o close that eventually, when Erik converted to Catholicism, Father Ted b=
ecame Erik=92s godfather. And he baptized both of Erik=92s children.=A0

Professionally, Father Ted was an enormous influence in Erik=92s life. He=
 encouraged Erik to pursue a graduate degree and a career in internationa=
l development, and helped Erik find research funding for his dissertation=
.

Father Ted also helped Erik return to Ecuador in the 1990s to start a hea=
lth care nonprofit, Andean Health and Development, which turned out to be=
 Erik=92s first exposure to USAID. The nonprofit, whose work was supporte=
d by a small USAID grant, worked to fundamentally change healthcare in ru=
ral Ecuador, training doctors to help communities prevent diseases throug=
h better nutrition and vaccination while also helping clinics treat patie=
nts through training and resources. Today, 100 percent of the staff in th=
e organization=92s health system are Ecuadorian, and 75 percent are women=
. For his work starting the organization and serving as its first Executi=
ve Director, Erik won the Dr. Thomas A. Dooley Award from Notre Dame=92s =
Alumni Association for outstanding service to humankind in 1999.=A0

Although he=92s traveling to North Africa, it=92s clear that Latin Americ=
a holds a special place in Erik=92s heart, especially since it=92s where =
he met his wife, Gloria. Gloria worked at a mall in Ecuador that Erik wou=
ld often visit to go to the bank and grab lunch. Almost every day, Erik w=
ould stop by and talk to Gloria at her store, under the pretext of stoppi=
ng by on his way to Kentucky Fried Chicken, which was right next door. It=
 took him several weeks to ask Gloria out for coffee, weeks in which Erik=
=92s lunches almost solely consisted of KFC. Does Erik actually like the =
Colonel's secret recipe? Let=92s just say we all make sacrifices for love=
.

After stops at Notre Dame and the Peace Corps headquarters, Erik eventual=
ly joined the Foreign Service with USAID in 2004. Erik=92s first post was=
 at USAID=92s Mission in Uganda, where he worked as a health officer. His=
 focus, from the very beginning, was localization. At the time, a large U=
.S.-based contractor specializing in logistics and commodities handled mu=
ch of the Mission=92s health work. Erik was part of the effort to help Ug=
andan partners benefit from that opportunity. He helped design a new prog=
ram that would set up a local organization to take over the work then bei=
ng handled by the larger company. The program was such a success that, te=
n years later and long after he left Uganda, Erik received an email from =
one of the local staff with the news that the local partner had just won =
an award for their health work.

Since that first posting in Uganda, Erik has spent close to two decades a=
s a career member of the Senior Foreign Service, serving in Peru, Afghani=
stan, Guatemala, DC of course, and most recently, North Macedonia.

Everywhere he has traveled, he=92s had an impact. In Guatemala, he helped=
 create a major new public-private alliance to create economic opportunit=
ies in the Western Highlands. In Afghanistan, he helped provide tens of m=
illions of dollars in direct funding to the Afghan ministries for health =
and education, helping to educate girls and supporting NGOs providing lif=
esaving medical care for Afghan communities, particularly women. And in N=
orth Macedonia, during his tenure, the Mission=92s yearly budget more tha=
n tripled. He not only had to manage this increase of funds, but did so w=
hile managing operations through the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, a=
nd of course, the country=92s name change.=A0

Wherever Erik goes, he remains deeply committed to colleagues. One cowork=
er from North Macedonia remembered how, during the first few months of th=
e pandemic, he stopped by the homes of his staff members to personally de=
liver chocolate to help mitigate the mental health effects of isolation. =
Erik=92s past experiences have prepared him well for his newest post: Mis=
sion Director for USAID/Morocco.

The United States and Morocco have enjoyed strong diplomatic relations fo=
r over 200 years. Morocco was the first country to recognize the newly in=
dependent United States, and since 1960, the Agency has worked to support=
 the welfare of the Moroccan people.

Today, Morocco faces the worst seasonal drought the country has seen in 3=
0 years, and water levels in dams and reservoirs around the country are s=
inking rapidly. The Abdelmoumen Dam in Agadir, for example, which supplie=
s the region of Morocco that produces the most fruits and vegetables, is =
filled to just four percent of its capacity.

The drought has worsened the country=92s rising food and fuel prices amid=
st a tough economic climate. Nationally, one in ten Moroccans are unemplo=
yed and about 80 percent of those unemployed are young people. In respons=
e, USAID is providing capital funding to nearly a thousand struggling coo=
peratives to help pay for equipment, raw materials, and production tools,=
 supporting a crucial part of Morocco=92s economy and its fight against p=
overty.=A0

But our work extends far beyond responding to immediate needs. Morocco ha=
s always been a place where the Government takes smaller pilot programs a=
nd scales them nationally =96 a model of how we want our work to evolve o=
ver time. For years, the Agency has helped boost government accountabilit=
y, support local elections, and expand participation in civil society and=
 government among minority communities including young people, women, and=
 persons with disabilities. And within the last decade, thanks to USAID=92=
s partnership with the Ministry of Education, the National Program for Re=
ading has helped more than 4 million grade schoolers across 24,000 public=
 and private schools read at grade level =96 just one of many of our effo=
rts to educate young people and help them lift themselves out of poverty.=


Our work in Morocco requires a leader able to build on this work and tack=
le the challenges faced by the Moroccan people. Someone who can make an i=
mpact beyond the programs we implement. Someone who truly has a heart for=
 service, and of course, who will take advantage of all the KFCs that Mor=
occo has to offer.

Erik is that someone in every respect, and I=92m grateful that he will be=
 representing the Agency, and the U.S., in Morocco. With that, it=92s my =
pleasure to administer the oath of office.

 the Mission=92s health work. Erik was part of the effort to help Ugandan=
 partners benefit from that opportunity. He helped design a new program t=
hat would set up a local organization to take over the work then being ha=
