*TRANSCRIPT*

*Administrator Samantha Power and Chef Tom Colicchio Host Twitter Spaces =
Discussion with Experts on the Hunger Crisis in the Horn of Africa*

*Virtual*

*TOM COLICCHIO:=A0*Hey out there, we're going to get started in a second,=
 waiting for a few more people to come on. Today we're on Twitter Spaces,=
 talking about the drought in the Horn of Africa. Just everybody, a few m=
ore minutes before we start. Before we start, I want to thank Administrat=
or Power and USAID for hosting this conversation and bringing together th=
is extraordinary group of humanitarians.

I'm Tom Colicchio. You may know me from my work on Top Chef. But, today, =
I'm here to host this most timely conversation about the global food cris=
is and the scale and severity, which is unprecedented. Some of you may al=
ready be following the crisis. And for some of you, this may be real new =
information that we've seen a lot of terrifying headlines. And we're gonn=
a sort of try to tease out what they mean. How did we get here? And so to=
day we're going to talk about the perfect storm of horrific events that h=
ave led to this moment. And we're going to learn from some of the leading=
 voices about how their organizations are mobilizing working day in and d=
ay out to combat this growing food crisis.=A0

Specifically, we'll be talking about what is happening in the Horn of Afr=
ica. It's a large Peninsula and Africa is currently being wrecked by the =
worst drought in decades resulting in catastrophic levels of humanitarian=
 need. The Horn of Africa is composed of a number of countries including =
Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia. And we're honored to be joined by local exp=
erts that are meeting the urgent needs on the ground in these three count=
ries. And they represent some of the world's most vulnerable in the crisi=
s. And so I want to thank, ahead of time, Rania Dagash from UNICEF's regi=
onal office for Eastern and Southern Africa, Lauren Landis from the World=
 Food Programme, that she's the Kenya Country Director, and Frantz Celest=
in is the Chief of Mission in Somalia for the International Organization =
for Migration. I want to thank all of them for joining us today. And, aga=
in, Administrator Power. Thanks.=A0

So, before we dive in, if anybody would like to, if you're listening, and=
 you're compelled to take action, at any point, you can go to gofundme.co=
m/globalfoodfund [ http://gofundme.com/globalfoodfund?utm_medium=3Demail&=
utm_source=3Dgovdelivery ] to make a contribution. All the organizations =
are vetted and they're all on the frontlines of fighting this crisis. So,=
 you know, I have been active for the last 20-30 years, helping to allevi=
ate hunger in America and hunger in America is very different. It's usual=
ly a crisis of a lack of nutrition and it can, it doesn't come from droug=
ht, or from war, or from famine. It's usually political reasons why peopl=
e in our country aren't getting fed but this is very different.=A0

So, first question I have is for Samantha. You just recently came back fr=
om a trip on the ground there, what were you seeing?

*ADMINISTRATOR POWER: *Thank you so much, Tom. And thanks to everybody wh=
o's joined today, this is not the happiest of topics. But it distinguishe=
s itself from other humanitarian events in the world, in that there's som=
ething we can do about it. And that's an exciting aspect of this. But tha=
t only happens when awareness grows and people dig into the facts and ope=
n their hearts to what's happening pretty far away.=A0

So that's partly why I went, right, is to see up close, to be able to mov=
e beyond the statistics that we read in the newspaper every day, to meet =
the individuals affected, to also meet staff with the World Food Programm=
e, UNICEF, IOM =96 like those we have on the call today who are doing God=
's work on the ground. In essence, Tom, what we have is a situation where=
 in this part of the world, rainy seasons are essential, because you need=
 the rains in order to grow the crops, in order to harvest the crops, in =
order to feed folks. And a couple of things are happening at once.=A0

First of all, the two rainy seasons a year that normally happen are basic=
ally becoming dry seasons or have become dry seasons. And so over the yea=
rs, in recorded history, there's actually never been a circumstance that =
anybody is aware of where you've had four straight failed rainy seasons, =
where the rains just fail. You know, if there's a drop, you're lucky, but=
 nothing's sufficient to grow and to harvest in the way that folks are us=
ed to.

That had never happened before. And now we're in our fourth and the World=
 Meteorological Organization has just reported actually, in the last few =
days, new models that show with a high degree of confidence that the regi=
on is going to experience its fifth straight, failed rainy season. So, th=
at's one aspect of it.=A0

The other thing that's going on, of course, is Putin, for no good reason,=
 decided gratuitously to brutalize the people of Ukraine. The effect of t=
hat has been to limit what Ukrainians are able to grow and harvest. Lucki=
ly, the blockade that had been put in place blocking Ukrainian grains fro=
m reaching the world market has been eased significantly by a UN-Turkey d=
eal. So that's very, very significant. But, that came very late. And so f=
ood, fuel, and fertilizer prices, already which were spiking, because of =
inflation, now compounded by that war, and its knock on effects.=A0

And what I saw on the ground finally, to your question, is a degree of de=
spair and deprivation that I have not seen in my two, three-decades caree=
r traveling to places where heartbreaking things are happening. And maybe=
 the best example I would offer is livestock.=A0

You know, they often say in that part of the world, the animals die first=
. And what you have right now are nearly 9 million livestock who have alr=
eady died in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. That's actually an increase of=
 3 million who have died just since July. And what does that mean? You kn=
ow, some of you are familiar with pastoralists. You know, who herd these =
animals, depend on these animals for livelihoods, who travel around with =
these animals, their home for thousands of years, their families have bee=
n, you know, practicing pastoralism. Now, suddenly they went from having =
maybe 500 animals, goats, camels, et cetera to having four, or to having =
zero, and to suddenly find themselves not only with nothing to eat or no =
source of income, but nothing to do. And we heard reports of suicides amo=
ng pastoralists. You then see mothers who have children whose arms are as=
 thin, thinner than a watch face. Who are in desperate need of urgent nut=
rition, therapeutic feeding. And that's something that the organizations =
on this call are providing mercifully.

But imagine being a mother and just, you know, two seasons ago or two yea=
rs ago, being able to feed your kids. You know, you're never living in th=
e lap of luxury, but you're able to make ends meet. And then suddenly, th=
e rains fail, the prices go up. Fertilizer prices are doubling and tripli=
ng so if you are a small scale farmer. Well, you're able to plant much le=
ss, and you suddenly can't feed your family. And what does that feel like=
 or you have to go to a humanitarian organization and ask for help for th=
e first time in your life? So that's the degree of desperation. And the m=
ain thing, just to leave folks with is, this is more than 20 million peop=
le in this region called the Horn of Africa who are on the brink of starv=
ation. That is the equivalent to every single person in the state of Flor=
ida at risk. It is a huge number of people. And while the American people=
 and the Congress have been, have been generous, we do not see the kind o=
f response that we need globally to meet these needs and get these vulner=
able families through this devastating time. And that's why we've come to=
gether and hope to raise awareness. Hope you can tell your friends and fa=
mily members what's out there and and support these organizations on the =
ground who are trying to keep people afloat, as well as build in more res=
ilience. So the next time there are four or five failed rainy seasons in =
a row, the families are better able to withstand these kinds of climate s=
hocks.

Tom, you might be on mute. Tom, you are muted if you are speaking.

*RANIA DAGASH: *You know, Samantha while Tom comes online and colleagues,=
 this is Rania, from UNICEF. There is so much in what you said that reson=
ates. I don't know where to start. I am from this region. And I have neve=
r seen it this bad. I've been doing this work for 22 years.

And I don't think I ever broke down in every conversation that I have had=
 with a mother or a grandmother or a nurse or a colleague like I did in S=
omalia the last few weeks.

*ADMINISTRATOR POWER: *Tom, are you back online? Nope, keep going. I thin=
k it's great to hear from you on the ground. And I think that was going t=
o be Tom's next question anyway, is, you know, good to ask you. What keep=
s you up at night? In light of the backdrop that we've tried to describe =
so far?=A0

*RANIA DAGASH: *No, absolutely. And thank you for gathering us today; Che=
f really. And to all of you who are on this call, you know, the 20 millio=
n people that you refer to now, Samantha, 10 million are children. And th=
at certainly keeps me and hundreds of the UNICEF colleagues, I think, up =
at night along with many. These 10 million children are at the sharp end =
of this drought in a climate and a human-made crisis that they didn't eve=
n create. I think that is a thought for all of us. I think the pockets of=
 conflict certainly add to the suffering that the children go through. An=
d we see a huge upsurge in child death. And we fear that we may see more =
of that simply because the world didn't act in time.

I should say that I met a mother in Dolo, on the border of Somalia and Et=
hiopia, on the Somali side. And she was pregnant, had two children, one-y=
ear-old twins. And she had walked for 160 kilometers to make it to the ca=
mp where we were giving service along with many local actors who have bee=
n absolutely brilliant at leading this response with us. And she is the s=
tory of many mothers and grandmothers that we saw. And she's lucky that s=
he made it because we could save her children. They came to a stabilizati=
on center where we provided nutrition and we could help her save her chil=
dren. There are many more that are left behind that we couldn't get to. I=
 can't get out of my head the tiny mounds of earth that mark children's g=
raves when you enter a camp that has just been set up. And the stories of=
 mothers that say they left. They bury children along the way as they wer=
e walking to us. So a lot, I would argue, keeps us up at night. And what =
will happen to the million more in the few months to come.

Many can't recover from this crisis, as we said, and we don't want to kee=
p coming back to seek assistance, the way that we do. Nor do the people t=
hat we support want us to do that. But it is fundamental to my mind, that=
 we rethink the way that we're funding malnutrition and gout. We need lon=
ger term predictable funding to stop needless death and early action from=
 governments and the international community at the first sign of a crisi=
s. We flagged this pretty early I would say but the response has been ver=
y slow. And had it not been for the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance and=
 your support, being the lead donor for us at UNICEF in this response, I =
think we would have seen a massive explosion of children deaths as we had=
 predicted. So we're very grateful for the support that we have. I'll sto=
p there.

*ADMINISTRATOR POWER:* Thank you. Thank you so much. I think we're still =
=96 Tom is able to listen, but not yet, I think able to rejoin us as a sp=
eaker, although we're working on that. It's very powerful. And as you sai=
d, it's, you have in your mind, the memory of this woman who had walked m=
ore than 100 miles. When we hear from IOM, we'll hear about the mass disp=
lacement that has accompanied this crisis. Because if you are a parent, o=
r if you are an individual in search of food, and there's no food around =
you, you take flight. That means massive disruption, but also an influx, =
a very destabilizing influx of people into communities that often aren't =
equipped to absorb those populations. But as you said, she was one of the=
 lucky ones and those who reach UNICEF, WFP, IOM, they are the lucky ones=
. And we have to bear in mind those we are not seeing as we think about, =
again, how to mobilize a much more substantial response. I wonder, Lauren=
, from the World Food Programme, if I could turn it over to you and pose =
the same question, but you can take it in any direction. But what keeps y=
ou up at night against this, this grim backdrop?

*LAUREN LANDIS: *Thank you, Samantha, and just very happy to join this co=
nversation and all of you, from the World Food Programme here in Kenya. A=
nd I really, like Rania said, I really feel that this entire conversation=
 resonates so well. Three seasons, when, of no rains, we saw the loss of =
animals, you would drive down county roads, and you'd see dead carcasses =
on both sides of the road. And as you've said before, that many people lo=
st their livelihoods, about even just in Kenya, about 4.5 million livesto=
ck. But then as we got, as Rania said, as we got into this fourth season =
of no rain, we saw the admission into malnutrition centers just go up, up=
, up and up. And I guess what really keeps me up at night is what will fi=
ve seasons of no or poor rains =96 what will those bring to these very vu=
lnerable people? How long can you go without rain before we see large sca=
le loss of life? I think, I'd just like to add though, you started Samant=
ha by saying this is a crisis that we can do something about. And I just =
want to really reiterate that due to the generous support of USAID and th=
e American people, we have immediately jumped in to try and make a differ=
ence. And instead of distributing food in Kenya, we have been able to mov=
e to cash phones to really increase by five fold in the last year, the nu=
mber of people that we're reaching the drought response. So how that migh=
t work, or how that does work, is that through their mobile phone a house=
hold, a family of six, receives about 6,500 shillings, which is about $60=
. So a household of six for an entire month, but that resource allows the=
m to go out and on the local market, buy food, and then take care of thei=
r most critical life saving needs, maybe medical care, maybe paying off d=
ebts, because they've been borrowing from neighbors to pay for food. And =
to maybe pay, I don't know their rent, so that they can continue to survi=
ve in a really dignified way.

The World Food Programme also really supports what's called moderate acut=
e malnutrition. So the children that are malnourished, but not as critica=
l that they need to be in a hospital. And we've, with the support of USAI=
D, have been scaling up. We used to just do this kind of treatment in fou=
r counties. And now we're moving it very quickly to 15 counties, to reall=
y serve these children, to prevent them from becoming acutely malnourishe=
d, and to bring them sort of back to life, so that they can survive and t=
hrive. I'll stop there.

*ADMINISTRATOR POWER: *Thank you so much. I know we don't have a ton of t=
ime, but we're gonna want to shift to describing what all of us, what mor=
e all of us can do. But I would love now to turn to Frantz of the Interna=
tional Organization for Migration. Frantz over to you.

*FRANTZ CELESTIN: *Thank you very much. And to follow up on what my colle=
agues are saying, what's keeping me up at night is this thought that it's=
 about to get worse. As you've heard, there is a fifth rainy season in th=
e forecast, which means there'll be no space between this drought and the=
 next one. This will reduce the people's capacity to cope and their abili=
ty to recover. So less milk, less meat, increased hunger, and most likely=
, increase in mortality. The compounding effect on the general population=
 will be catastrophic. So far, we've actually seen about a million people=
 displaced. And that's on top of the 2.9 million people who've been displ=
aced over the years by conflicts and other natural disasters. So, I've se=
en people displaced two, three, four times, because the land they used to=
 rely on can no longer provide. As you pointed out in the beginning, in S=
omalia, in some areas, 1/3 of their livestock have been decimated. To mak=
e it =96 to make matters worse =96 those that survive can no longer repro=
duce. So as you can imagine, this has a double whammy effect on the peopl=
e. So, you have increasing hunger will force people to move, and compete =
over resources, which leads to communal violence, leading to more displac=
ement. This is why I'm calling this drought a threat multiplier. So, as y=
ou know, IOM, WFP and UNICEF, we are working together to provide an integ=
rated package that includes water hygiene, sanitation, shelter, nutrition=
, health, and cash to families who've been displaced. And so at IOM, we a=
re going to where the people are to make sure that they don't move in the=
 first place to provide that support, to enhance their capacity, and also=
 to enhance their resilience.

Because we want to improve their ability to bounce forward, not just boun=
cing back because that would go to the status quo. And this is why we are=
 increasing our footprint in the ground. So far, we have about 650 staff =
on the ground, working with government, NGOs, and also the UN providing t=
hose items that I mentioned, looking after about 450,000 internally displ=
aced persons. We said we just provided about 400 million liters of water =
to those in need.

So our job at IOM and within the system, the humanitarian system, is to, =
well, return our capacity to deliver today. Giving these life-saving emer=
gency tents, we should put the building blocks in place to prevent people=
 from dying in the future. We would like to see those displaced to have a=
 horizon beyond the tent and a future beyond humanitarian aid. This is wh=
y we're working with communities to better prepare to withstand the shock=
s you mentioned. And I think in any event, six failed rainy seasons is in=
 the forecast. And that's not too far. So, we have to work together to pr=
ovide the support to those in need. I'll stop here. Thank you very much.

*ADMINISTRATOR POWER:* Thanks, Frantz. Tom, do we have you, I see you as =
a co-host, but I don't know if your mic is working. No, okay. Oh, is that=
 you? No, okay, so tech is not our friend today.=A0

I wanted to just pivot now, in our remaining minutes to what more each of=
 us can do. And, you know, this whole setup here is not designed to have =
large international organizations praise USAID or the U.S. Government. Bu=
t there is a sort of good news and bad news. The good news is, thanks to =
the Congress coming together and passing two very substantial Ukraine sup=
plementals that allow for much greater resources to be dedicated =96 so t=
o the food crisis =96 the U.S. has been able to step up as a government i=
n a major way allowing these organizations, or contributing at least to t=
heir ability, to provide some of the services that you've heard about. Th=
e problem is that other countries that traditionally have joined the Unit=
ed States are coming in with much less significant contributions than the=
y have in the past. And just to get specific about that, there was a drou=
ght not nearly as severe as this one in the same region in the 2016 and 2=
017 period. And again, much, much less severe in terms of the numbers of =
people affected, the number of kids at risk, the number of livestock, we =
had never seen number, like those we've described in terms of livestock d=
eath, which again, are sadly, a canary in the coal mine, for what lies ah=
ead. Too much worse today and yet, the funding is down 66%, from what it =
was in response to the 2017 drought. The United States, for example, when=
 it comes to the World Food Programme, I think accounts for something clo=
se to 85% of the overall World Food Programme appeal for the Horn of Afri=
ca. And that's just not sustainable. I mean, there's just not enough mone=
y in any one country's bank account, given the scale of this need, and th=
e needs in other parts of the world as well. I mean, look at Pakistan tod=
ay, and the flooding there.

USAID and all donors looking to see how they can contribute, look at the =
very specific needs and in places like Tigray that are conflict affected,=
 as well as affected by some of these larger structure forces. So there i=
s a ton of need out there =96 we need other countries to step up in the w=
ays that they have in the past. We're hopeful that the UN General Assembl=
y, which is approaching here in September, will give countries an excuse =
to step forward and to step up. We're hopeful that large powers like Chin=
a will contribute to international organizations, as well at the scale th=
at is needed. That is something that could be very important, but hasn't =
yet happened. And there is a GoFundMe page that I just want to make every=
body aware of, it's gofundme.com [ http://gofundme.com/?utm_medium=3Demai=
l&utm_source=3Dgovdelivery ]. Tom mentioned it earlier, gofundme.com/glob=
alfoodfund [ http://gofundme.com/globalfoodfund?utm_medium=3Demail&utm_so=
urce=3Dgovdelivery ]. So, the contributions there have not been that subs=
tantial from individuals yet, but we're hoping with more attention to the=
 crisis that that will change.=A0=A0

I want to just open the floor to the organizations, again, that will get =
funded and the programs that will get funded through these kinds of contr=
ibutions that I've been speaking to. Would Rania or Frantz or Lauren like=
 to add anything here as to what is most needed now in terms of resources=
?=A0=A0

*RANIA DAGASH:* Yeah.=A0=A0

*FRANTZ CELESTIN: *Okay.=A0=A0

*RANIA DAGASH: *Frantz, do you want to go?

*FRANTZ CELESTIN: *Yeah, sure. So, on our side here, and thanking you and=
 the American people, the taxpayers, the American government. The drought=
 response and the Drought Response Plan is 78% of the funding that we rec=
eived so far came from the American people. So, we would join the Adminis=
trator, asking other countries to join. And individuals also, you can mak=
e a great impact on the people we touch.=A0=A0

So far, there are some underfunded sectors here, clusters here: health, w=
ater, wash, specifically, and also CCCM =96 Camp Management and Camp Coor=
dination. Despite the fact that the original humanitarian response plan w=
as supposed to address about 5 million people. Now it has been updated to=
 target 7.8 million people. In fact, we are still looking at the numbers,=
 they will keep growing. And that's why I said that it=92s about to get w=
orse, is keeping me up at night. Because if they are as they are now, bec=
ause last week =96 the week of August 25th =96 52,000 people were newly d=
isplaced. And that was a 16 percent increase over the last week, and we s=
ee increasing numbers being displaced. Right now, we are planning for 7.8=
 million. I am afraid it's going to be more if as the forecast predicts w=
e have a fifth failed rainy season. So, thank you.

*ADMINISTRATOR POWER:* Thank you. Lauren, or Rania?

*LAUREN LANDIS: *I can jump in quickly. You=92re =96 Administrator =96 yo=
u're absolutely right, in that we have received drought funding from eigh=
t other donors other than USAID. But it's really a very small amount comp=
ared to the contributions we've received from the American people. And qu=
ite frankly, at the level, even of the very high level of funding, we can=
 only continue to provide drought assistance for say another six months. =
If, as IOM suggests, we see this fifth rainy season, or something even wo=
rse, we will not have the resources to continue our assistance, to take, =
not only save the lives of those people affected by drought, but also to =
help them quickly recover to get back on their feet.=A0=A0

And that also leads me to bring up another point that I think is critical=
. It really has been already mentioned today. Really, it all comes down t=
o resilience. And I think that's a quote I take from you, Administrator. =
And that is that =93we have to do a better job.=94 And we have to support=
 making sure that these people do not fall down when these shocks hit, an=
d that they're more resilient and can recover both their lives and their =
livelihoods much quicker. So, I would also encourage that as we're fundin=
g drought assistance, that we're also thinking, how can we support resili=
ence? Thank you.

*ADMINISTRATOR POWER: *Great. Rania?

*RANIA DAGASH: *Thank you, Administrator. And I couldn't agree more with =
my colleagues.=A0=A0

You know, Samantha, in these places, we don't just thank you for the supp=
ort you extend, but we also would like to ask for your voice and the voic=
e of the American people and the government at large. Not just to help us=
 spread the word and ask other member states and donors to support us. Bu=
t also, to make the point that Lauren just ended with: we will be back he=
re having the same conversation in two, three years, because we know for =
a fact this is climate-induced, and the droughts are coming back. But wha=
t we can do in terms of making smart investments in longer term, sorry, i=
n the resilience of communities. This is about digging boreholes, you kno=
w, with sustainable aquifers where we can. This is about putting social p=
rotection systems with governments so that they can support their own peo=
ple and communities. It's reliable sources of groundwater and expanding a=
ll of these programs, which will enable better nutrition, allow children =
to go back to schools, allow us to be able to actually create communities=
 and their coherence together.=A0=A0

And I =96 if I were =96 I didn't want to give numbers at all in this conv=
ersation. But our life saving response continues and it is critical, but =
it has to be underpinned by the longer-term resilience and your voice wit=
h the governments of the countries to also make that investment. I think =
it's quite critical that we don't shy away from holding all of us to acco=
unt on the longer-term solutions. This isn't going away anytime soon. And=
 if we don't respond to it, like I said, we'll be back having the same co=
nversation in a few years. And I hope that we can reduce those that are e=
xposed in a few years=92 time through this collective action.=A0=A0

So, thank you.

*ADMINISTRATOR POWER:* Thank you so much. And, of course, again, compound=
ing tragedy with tragedy, this is a crisis in which, you know, with a lim=
ited pie of resources globally, you know, investing so much in emergency =
response inevitably does pull away resources. You know, from donors, or f=
rom government or governments themselves from these longer term investmen=
ts that make it less likely that people would have to flee or would face =
acute malnutrition in the future. And those tradeoffs are very difficult,=
 but I think every donor, every individual, every philanthropy, you know,=
 to look at what can be done in the very near term to save lives, but als=
o what are the organizations to invest in, that are making these commitme=
nts to communities? For example, to transition from pastoralism, if that =
is what is required, if livestock, you know, have died at scale in this c=
risis, there may be opportunities to get the young kids who might have be=
en herding animals to school. But where are those school fees going to co=
me from? You know, are the governments in countries where these kinds of =
calamities have occurred. Are they going to make those investments in try=
ing to smooth the path for families to transition in that way? What about=
 the boreholes or shifting communities, again, to smarter seeds that are =
going to be more drought resistant? There's so much to be done in the res=
ilience space. And we just need to simultaneously save lives in the momen=
t and make those investments. And I think, you know, the World Food Progr=
amme, UNICEF, the International Organization for Migration, are three lar=
ge international organizations that provide emergency support. But also, =
more and more are thinking about how this emergency support can serve med=
ium-and long-term objectives. And that's absolutely critical.=A0=A0

Before we close, I'm looking at Tom here, who just had microphone problem=
s throughout, but I think has been able to hear all of this. But he menti=
oned in the beginning, I have reinforced this website, gofundme.com/globa=
lfoodfund [ http://gofundme.com/globalfoodfund?utm_medium=3Demail&utm_sou=
rce=3Dgovdelivery ]. Any small contribution can make a difference for som=
eone out there who will never know your name but will depend in the prese=
nt and in the future on the kind of support that the organizations that y=
ou've heard from here today are providing. And all three of the organizat=
ions who have these teams on the ground doing the work that's been descri=
bed, are receiving contributions from this Global Food Fund through GoFun=
dMe. So, if you can do that, but if not, please do raise your voice, urge=
 elected officials to make resources available. We cannot afford to wait =
for the kind of ghastly images that we all have seen in the past and that=
 could be much more, sort of, at the =96- could be an exponentially large=
r number of communities and individuals affected this time around. The wa=
y to save lives is to make these contributions now, because we know what'=
s coming and we know unfortunately that this crisis is going to be with u=
s for some time.

So, thank you, everybody. Thank you Tom, for being with us and for loanin=
g your platform, gofundme.com/globalfoodfund [ http://gofundme.com/global=
foodfund?utm_medium=3Demail&utm_source=3Dgovdelivery ]. Thanks to everybo=
dy for joining and for all of the work that they're doing on the front li=
nes to try to support people facing this great crisis. Thank you, everybo=
dy.=A0

ng>ADMINISTRATOR POWER: </strong>Thank you so much, Tom. And thanks to ev=
erybody who's joined today, this is not the happiest of topics. But it di=
stinguishes itself from other humanitarian events in the world, in that t=
here's something we can do about it. And that's an exciting aspect of thi=
s. But that only happens when awareness grows and people dig into the fac=
ts and open their hearts to what's happening pretty far away.=A0</p>

at's partly why I went, right, is to see up close, to be able to move bey=
ond the statistics that we read in the newspaper every day, to meet the i=
ndividuals affected, to also meet staff with the World Food Programme, UN=
ICEF, IOM =96 like those we have on the call today who are doing God's wo=
rk on the ground. In essence, Tom, what we have is a situation where in t=
his part of the world, rainy seasons are essential, because you need the =
rains in order to grow the crops, in order to harvest the crops, in order=
 to feed folks. And a couple of things are happening at once.=A0</p>
<p style=3D'-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; -ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; l=

color: #000000; text-align: left; margin: 0 0 15px;' align=3D"left">First=
 of all, the two rainy seasons a year that normally happen are basically =
becoming dry seasons or have become dry seasons. And so over the years, i=
n recorded history, there's actually never been a circumstance that anybo=
dy is aware of where you've had four straight failed rainy seasons, where=
 the rains just fail. You know, if there's a drop, you're lucky, but noth=
ing's sufficient to grow and to harvest in the way that folks are used to=
.</p>
<p style=3D'-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; -ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; l=

had never happened before. And now we're in our fourth and the World Mete=
orological Organization has just reported actually, in the last few days,=
 new models that show with a high degree of confidence that the region is=
 going to experience its fifth straight, failed rainy season. So, that's =
one aspect of it.=A0</p>
<p style=3D'-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; -ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; l=

ther thing that's going on, of course, is Putin, for no good reason, deci=
ded gratuitously to brutalize the people of Ukraine. The effect of that h=
as been to limit what Ukrainians are able to grow and harvest. Luckily, t=
he blockade that had been put in place blocking Ukrainian grains from rea=
ching the world market has been eased significantly by a UN-Turkey deal. =
So that's very, very significant. But, that came very late. And so food, =
fuel, and fertilizer prices, already which were spiking, because of infla=
tion, now compounded by that war, and its knock on effects.=A0</p>

hat I saw on the ground finally, to your question, is a degree of despair=
 and deprivation that I have not seen in my two, three-decades career tra=
veling to places where heartbreaking things are happening. And maybe the =
best example I would offer is livestock.=A0</p>
<p style=3D'-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; -ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; l=

now, they often say in that part of the world, the animals die first. And=
 what you have right now are nearly 9 million livestock who have already =
died in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. That's actually an increase of 3 mi=
llion who have died just since July. And what does that mean? You know, s=
ome of you are familiar with pastoralists. You know, who herd these anima=
ls, depend on these animals for livelihoods, who travel around with these=
 animals, their home for thousands of years, their families have been, yo=
u know, practicing pastoralism. Now, suddenly they went from having maybe=
 500 animals, goats, camels, et cetera to having four, or to having zero,=
 and to suddenly find themselves not only with nothing to eat or no sourc=
e of income, but nothing to do. And we heard reports of suicides among pa=
storalists. You then see mothers who have children whose arms are as thin=
, thinner than a watch face. Who are in desperate need of urgent nutritio=
n, therapeutic feeding. And that's something that the organizations on th=
is call are providing mercifully.</p>
<p style=3D'-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; -ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; l=

magine being a mother and just, you know, two seasons ago or two years ag=
o, being able to feed your kids. You know, you're never living in the lap=
 of luxury, but you're able to make ends meet. And then suddenly, the rai=
ns fail, the prices go up. Fertilizer prices are doubling and tripling so=
 if you are a small scale farmer. Well, you're able to plant much less, a=
nd you suddenly can't feed your family. And what does that feel like or y=
ou have to go to a humanitarian organization and ask for help for the fir=
st time in your life? So that's the degree of desperation. And the main t=
hing, just to leave folks with is, this is more than 20 million people in=
 this region called the Horn of Africa who are on the brink of starvation=
. That is the equivalent to every single person in the state of Florida a=
t risk. It is a huge number of people. And while the American people and =
the Congress have been, have been generous, we do not see the kind of res=
ponse that we need globally to meet these needs and get these vulnerable =
families through this devastating time. And that's why we've come togethe=
r and hope to raise awareness. Hope you can tell your friends and family =
members what's out there and and support these organizations on the groun=
d who are trying to keep people afloat, as well as build in more resilien=
ce. So the next time there are four or five failed rainy seasons in a row=
, the families are better able to withstand these kinds of climate shocks=

sharp end of this drought in a climate and a human-made crisis that they =

ere we were giving service along with many local actors who have been abs=
olutely brilliant at leading this response with us. And she is the story =
of many mothers and grandmothers that we saw. And she's lucky that she ma=
de it because we could save her children. They came to a stabilization ce=

 There are many more that are left behind that we couldn't get to. I can'=

 when you enter a camp that has just been set up. And the stories of moth=

as you said, it's, you have in your mind, the memory of this woman who ha=

ble to move to cash phones to really increase by five fold in the last ye=
ar, the number of people that we're reaching the drought response. So how=
 that might work, or how that does work, is that through their mobile pho=
ne a household, a family of six, receives about 6,500 shillings, which is=
 about $60. So a household of six for an entire month, but that resource =
allows them to go out and on the local market, buy food, and then take ca=
re of their most critical life saving needs, maybe medical care, maybe pa=
ying off debts, because they've been borrowing from neighbors to pay for =
food. And to maybe pay, I don't know their rent, so that they can continu=
e to survive in a really dignified way.</p>

t my colleagues are saying, what's keeping me up at night is this thought=
 that it's about to get worse. As you've heard, there is a fifth rainy se=
ason in the forecast, which means there'll be no space between this droug=
ht and the next one. This will reduce the people's capacity to cope and t=
heir ability to recover. So less milk, less meat, increased hunger, and m=
ost likely, increase in mortality. The compounding effect on the general =
population will be catastrophic. So far, we've actually seen about a mill=
ion people displaced. And that's on top of the 2.9 million people who've =
been displaced over the years by conflicts and other natural disasters. S=
o, I've seen people displaced two, three, four times, because the land th=
ey used to rely on can no longer provide. As you pointed out in the begin=
ning, in Somalia, in some areas, 1/3 of their livestock have been decimat=
ed. To make it =96 to make matters worse =96 those that survive can no lo=
nger reproduce. So as you can imagine, this has a double whammy effect on=
 the people. So, you have increasing hunger will force people to move, an=
d compete over resources, which leads to communal violence, leading to mo=
re displacement. This is why I'm calling this drought a threat multiplier=
. So, as you know, IOM, WFP and UNICEF, we are working together to provid=
e an integrated package that includes water hygiene, sanitation, shelter,=
 nutrition, health, and cash to families who've been displaced. And so at=
 IOM, we are going to where the people are to make sure that they don't m=
ove in the first place to provide that support, to enhance their capacity=
