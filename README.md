<h2>TAX EVASION: GROSS NEGLIGENT PENALTY APPLIED (70% onto ROUGHLY $250 MILLION) carry-forward 10-years and for 6 properties</h2>
*** you can not purchase 144 apartments for less than $25 million dollars, even in a fire sale in Manhattan in the Year 2022.
*** you can not base-cap a property without a means to legally collect rent, and report that as lawful income to the NY FINANCE REGISTER
*** this is the information that was used in order for the Sullivan / Zucker DYNASTY to obtain a $6 million dollar loan from State Farm Life Insurance Company at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and assign all of their tax liabilities to the funny farm or evasion while they were executing a fine in New York, had no issues undermining the USDOJ, FINRA, or the SEC while placing ALL of their whole life and term life policy holders at risk.
*** upon receipt of a letter, stating those TAXES would cause harm - State Farm agreed to immediately pay whatever balance they felt would be in the interest of their shareholders.
*** below, the impossible rent rolls and ponzi scheme, for the USDOJ and NYSD to evaluate and understand, they can only be valued as individual units.
*** for gross negligence, see also the shift in the fed-30 during the 4th quarter of 2021 - roughly 300bps
