        Another felony, another NYSCEF 251334/2021

        And an attempt to defraud again, while dealing in 153974/2020 as referenced below to obtain some $600,000 discount or something.. 

        I don’t care, I just know it’s corruption and at the expense of my unlawful restraint, you understand what that is?

        look at that email between laurie Zucker and Steve Donnell, what did they talk about??? Anything going on in the STFGX ticker prices then in December of 2021. They were trying to snatch another $600,000 from the state while keeping me preoccupied.
