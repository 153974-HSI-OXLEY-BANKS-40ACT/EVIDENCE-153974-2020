THANK YOU AGAIN GOVERNOR HOCHUL & CO. FOR MAKING THIS A PRIORITY, 

    

IF YOU NEED ME TO EMAIL THE COURTS ETC. I CAN HANDLE THAT AS WELL, AND I'LL GET INTO THE PROCEDURAL AREAS FILED IN LATER TOMORROW FOR OTHER TO LOOK AT.

    

IDX, ref.: 166.  [ 111 SULLIVAN STREET, APT #2BR, NEW YORK, NY, 10012    -BLOCK 503, LOT 8 ]



I'm not sure how long it takes to process a bank wire, however as of current this money has not been returned to me and was brought to the attention of the Judge in the matter of 153974/2020 who did not contest my request, and have still not received those monies. In any event, if there's an issue with the FDIC communicating with the bank, I also included the individuals who I met with personally and at the most convenient Chase branch near my school.

 

The two bankers I met with personally provided me their information, and is below for convenience:

            JP Morgan Chase, N/A, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, 10020

The total amount I am owed is $31,135.00 for rent payments and security that was collected by Sullivan Properties LP and has not been effected, I am not wasting my time again with the courts, a Marshall or none of that - hence IMMEDIATELY.


> ANY ACCRUED INTEREST IS THEIRS TO KEEP, ALLOCATE ANY OF THOSE MONIES TO ME, PER THE LEASE AND I WILL SEND IT BACK.

     

As instructed, I returned the keys to the landlord, no complaints have been filed in the building [ever], no damages or structural construction in BIN Code Number 1077252 - which is where I resided (48).  I attached the current schedule of complaints/violations/Jobs/work-orders if there is any feedback on the security deposit as well. The assets were transferred to JP Morgan Chase, as filed in the MDW matter (166) under the scope of their counselors and directors, and the judge who also understands where my reservations are with respect to wasting valuable time playing circus with these Plaintiffs.


HERE IS CURRENT BANK INFORMATION
- I EXPECT THE SAME "EMERGENCY PROVISIONS" AFFORDED AND TO RESTRAIN MYSELF DURING THOSE PROCEEDINGS-


BANK ADDRESS: 
2 WALL STREET
                                                    
NEW YORK, NY 10005

ACCOUNT NAME: 
BARIS DINCER
ACCOUNT NUMBER:  4410669969
ROUTING NUMBER:                      026013673

 

the drop-down menu selection on the FDIC site had the closest and most convenient branch, or any branch in the State of New York.


AS INSTRUCTED BY THE FDIC.

     
                I DIRECTED THIS TO THE CONSUMER COMPLAINT DEPT., AND ALSO WENT TO THE CONSUMER DEPT AT CHASE BANK.  IF YOU NEED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION, I AM HAPPY TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION, HOWEVER FILED IN 2020 IN THE PROCEDURAL MATTERS WHICH WERE EXPEDITED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AS AN "EMERGENCY” UPON RECEIPT OF AN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION FROM THEIR COUNSELORS. I WOULD PREFER NOT TO COMMUNICATE WITH JP MORGAN CHASE BANK, NA ANY FURTHER WHICH IS ALSO WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS SET ASIDE AND TO MITIGATE ANY FURTHER EXPOSURE AS SEEN WHILE DEALING WITH OTHER OPINIONS IN THIS MATTER. HENCE IT IS IMPORTANT THIS IS PROCESSED IMMEDIATELY AS JPM SHOULD HAVE NO FURTHER INVOLVEMENT BEYOND THEIR MINISTERIAL DUTIES AND IS THE INFORMATION IN THE LETTER THAT I WAS PROVIDED (166) BY SULLIVAN PROPERTIES LP.

 

HELD IN CUSTODY UNDER THEIR UMBRELLA OF THEIR ENTITIES, HENCE AN EMERGENCY - IN FACT - A MATTER THAT SHOULD BE TREATED AS "TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE" IN CONTROL AND CUSTODY OF SULLIVAN PROPERTIES LP, THEIR DIRECTORS, AFFILIATES, ATTORNEYS, REPRESENTATIVES, AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES.



THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING, AND SO THAT I CAN DISCONTINUE THIS THREAD WITHOUT HAVING TO PERSONALLY INTERVENE ANY FURTHER. I JUST REALIZED THIS WAS STILL AN ITEM OF CONCERN - AND HAS NOT BEEN PROCESSED AS OF CURRENT, HENCE "IMMEDIATELY: BEFORE THOSE DEPOSITS ARE "RESTRAINED" AND WITHOUT REASONABLE CAUSE, AND TO ULTIMATELY MITIGATE ANY FURTHER 'RISK' IN THIS RESPECT, IN CASE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE HEARD THAT WORD FROM ANYONE ELSE - IT WAS NOT MY INTENT TO SURPRISE YOU.

   

MOST RESPECTFULLY,



/S/ BO DINCER.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


P.S. SORRY FOR THE CAPS BUT I'M NOT TYPING THIS AGAIN
: )*


I INCLUDED GOVERNOR HOCHUL AS MY SOLE CONFIDANT

 - BUT ONLY BECAUSE I LACK THE INTELLIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO HANDLE MY AFFAIRS AS QUICKLY AS OTHERS,  AND I TRUST THAT HER AGENTS / ASSISTANTS WILL PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO THIS AND MAKE SURE IT IS HANDLED IMMEDIATELY AND UNDERSTAND THAT IS ALSO HOW I FUNCTION - HOWEVER NOT SOLELY FOR PERSONAL GAIN.


I WANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY TYPE OF COMPOUND INTEREST - OR ANYTHING THAT IS BUSINESS RELATED WITH RESPECT TO SULLIVAN PROPERTIES LP AND BEYOND THE EXTENT OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, ATTORNEYS, FRIENDS, OR ANYTHING - EVER. 

----  IF YOU DO SPEAK WITH THEM,  JUST TELL THEM TO SAVE THE INTEREST ACCRUALS FOR LATER AND PLEASE MAKE SURE EITHER YOURSELF OR ONE OF YOUR STAFF MEMBERS HANDLES THIS TOMORROW, AS IT IS AN "EMERGENCY".



 I WILL EMAIL YOU SEPARATELY UPON CONFIRMATION, BUT IN ALL” FAIRNESS” OF THE PROCEDURAL CONDUCT (VIA EMAIL IN THE MDW-MATTER), IS TO REMOVE ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION  FROM THE IMPLIED PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACTIONS AS WELL - NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

Re: Your Submission to the FDIC - Reference Number 01416925

Dear Baris Dincer:

The FDIC’s Consumer Response Unit has received your correspondence, and we are reviewing your concerns to determine the best approach to assist you. The information below will help explain how the FDIC plans to address your correspondence.



What happens now?

We will review your correspondence to determine whether the FDIC is the appropriate federal regulatory agency to respond to your inquiry or concerns. If you are writing about a bank that we regulate, we may contact the bank on your behalf.


In an effort to ensure the most complete response, we may ask the bank to respond directly to you and provide a copy to the FDIC. The FDIC will conduct an independent investigation into the matter, including a review of any and all supporting documentation provided by you and the bank. Upon completion, we will respond to you with applicable regulatory guidance. In this situation, you may expect to receive a response from the FDIC within 60 calendar days. We will attempt to notify you if we anticipate a longer review.



If the FDIC does not need to contact an FDIC-supervised bank for information to respond to your question or concern, you may expect to receive a response from the FDIC within 14 calendar days. 



If we determine your concerns fall outside of the purview of the FDIC, we will forward your correspondence to the appropriate federal regulatory agency. In this situation, we will notify you within 14 calendar days that your concerns have been referred to another agency. If you also contacted a state regulatory banking department regarding this matter and the FDIC is later contacted by the state department to share this information, the FDIC may consider this request.
