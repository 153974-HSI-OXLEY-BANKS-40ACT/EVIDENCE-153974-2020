[3 law firms - I Investment Adviser + 1 BUILDING CHAINED SHuT] - - GOOD 
LUCK EXPLAINING EX-POST MERGERS <EARL> LOSSES BY STATE FARM [ STFGX ]

*thats the GREATER of $850 million lost in about 5 minutes, did you 
forget to mention that to the Securities & Exchange Commission ?*
Ricki ,Shari, Amber, Sara, Steve, Marlyn, did you save 15% by switching 
your holding from STFGX to BRK-B prior to December 22nd 2021?
TICKER: STFGX, SFITX, SFBDX, STFBX.

Four tickers, and 100% of all ASSETS are vaporized, no longer under the 
management of CIK FILER 93715.
 > THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT I WROTE TO THEIR COUNSELORS ON THE 3RD of JULY 
2020, and they decided to file a law suit without any cause on JUNE 5TH 
2020.

But look what E-8 at State Farm instead, I just want to know which 
prison (if they are communally sentenced to the same one) I can send 
post-cards to.

/s/ BO DINCER.

> Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a 
> Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or

> in a judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling 
> or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, 
> accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his 
> knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization 
> in which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, general partner 
> or employee, or any person or organization with whom he is negotiating 
> or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a

> circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, 
> request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, 
> controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter 
> and makes full disclosure of the financial interest and receives in 
> advance a written determination made by such official that the 
> interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the 
> integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such 
> officer or employee;
> (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of 
> Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and 
> employees covered by this section, and published in the Federal 
> Register, the financial interest has been exempted from the 
> requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too 
> inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the 
> Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies;
> (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an 
> advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory 
> Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an 
> appointment to such a position), the official responsible for the 
> employee's appointment, after review of the financial disclosure 
> report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in Government 
> Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need for the individual's 
> services outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest created by 
> the financial interest involved...
