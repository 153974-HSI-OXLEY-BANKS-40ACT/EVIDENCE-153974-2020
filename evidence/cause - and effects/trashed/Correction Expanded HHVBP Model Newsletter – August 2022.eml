ance feedback provided through the expanded HHVBP Model. *These sample re=
ports do not include actual HHA performance data.*

The sample reports are available to each competing HHA on the Internet Qu=
ality Improvement and Evaluation System (iQIES [ https://iqies.cms.gov/ ]=
). The sample reports are based on the same scoring methodologies and oth=
er policies presented in the CY 2022 Home Health Prospective Payment Syst=
em (HH PPS) final rule [ https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/1=
1/09/2021-23993/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-cy-2022-home-health-prospe=

mance score and potential payment adjustments, and inform quality assuran=
ce and performance improvement (QAPI) initiatives.
