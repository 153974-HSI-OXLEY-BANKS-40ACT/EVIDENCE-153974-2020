LUCK EXPLAINING EX-POST MERGERS <EARL> LOSSES BY STATE FARM [ STFGX ]

*thats the GREATER of $850 million lost in about 5 minutes, did you 
forget to mention that to the Securities & Exchange Commission ?*
Ricki ,Shari, Amber, Sara, Steve, Marlyn, did you save 15% by switching 
your holding from STFGX to BRK-B prior to December 22nd 2021?
TICKER: STFGX, SFITX, SFBDX, STFBX.

Four tickers, and 100% of all ASSETS are vaporized, no longer under the 
management of CIK FILER 93715.
> THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT I WROTE TO THEIR COUNSELORS ON THE 3RD of JULY 
2020, and they decided to file a law suit without any cause on JUNE 5TH 
2020.

But look what E-8 at State Farm instead, I just want to know which 
prison (if they are communally sentenced to the same one) I can send 
post-cards to.

        taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or

        income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of
        racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt
        in which such person has participated as a principal within the

        for purposes of investment, and without the intention of
        controlling or participating in the control of the issuer, or of
        assisting another to do so, shall not be unlawful under this
        subsection if the securities of the issuer held by the
        purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their
        accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the
        collection of an unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount
        in the aggregate to one percent of the outstanding securities of
        any one class, and do not confer, either in law or in fact, the
        power to elect one or more directors of the issuer.<br>
        <br>
        (b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of

        <br>
        (c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or
        associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of
        which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or
        participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such
        enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity

        racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty includes
        life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit to the United
        States, irrespective of any provision of State law-<br>
        (1) any interest the person has acquired or maintained in
        violation of section 1962;<br>
        (2) any-<br>
        (A) interest in;<br>
        (B) security of;<br>
        (C) claim against; or<br>
        (D) property or contractual right of any kind affording a source
        of influence over;<br>
        any enterprise which the person has established, operated,
        controlled, conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in
        violation of section 1962; and<br>
        (3) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds
        which the person obtained, directly or indirectly, from
        racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation
        of section 1962.<br>
        The court, in imposing sentence on such person shall order, in
        addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this section,
        that the person forfeit to the United States all property
        described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise
        authorized by this section, a defendant who derives profits or
        other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than twice
        the gross profits or other proceeds.<br>
        (b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section
        includes-<br>
        (1) real property, including things growing on, affixed to, and
        found in land; and<br>
        (2) tangible and intangible personal property, including rights,

        ### USC 18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being
        an officer or employee of the executive branch of the United
        States Government, or of any independent agency of the United
        States, a Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee,
        or an officer or employee of the District of Columbia, including
        a special Government employee, participates personally and
        substantially as a Government officer or employee, through
        decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering
        of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other
        proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other
        determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation,
        arrest, or other particular matter in which, to his knowledge,
        he, his spouse, minor child, general partner, organization in
        which he is serving as officer, director, trustee, general
        partner or employee, or any person or organization with whom he
        is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective
        employment, has a financial interest-Shall be subject to the
        penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.<br>
        (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-<br>
        (1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government
        official responsible for appointment to his or her position of
        the nature and circumstances of the judicial or other
        proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other
        determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation,
        arrest, or other particular matter and makes full disclosure of
        the financial interest and receives in advance a written
        determination made by such official that the interest is not so
        substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of
        the services which the Government may expect from such officer
        or employee;<br>
        (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of
        Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all
        officers and employees covered by this section, and published in
        the Federal Register, the financial interest has been exempted
        from the requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or
        too inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of
        the Government officers or employees to which such regulation
        applies;<br>
        (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an
        advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory
        Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an
        appointment to such a position), the official responsible for
        the employee's appointment, after review of the financial
        disclosure report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics
        in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need
        for the individual's services outweighs the potential for a
        conflict of interest created by the financial interest
        involved...<br>
