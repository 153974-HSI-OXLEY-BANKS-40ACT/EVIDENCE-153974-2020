		Sergey Aleynikov, a 40-year-old former Goldman Sachs programmer, was found guilty on Friday by a federal jury in Manhattan of stealing proprietary source code from the bank’s high-frequency trading platform. 
		He was convicted on two counts theft of trade secrets and transportation of stolen property and faces up to 10 years in prison.
	

During the two-week trial, Judge Denise L. Cote closed the courtroom to the public several times to protect Goldman’s proprietary source code. Yet several details emerged about the firm’s high-frequency trading business, including that the unit accounted for about $300 million in revenue last year, less than 1 percent of Goldman’s total revenue of $45 billion.

On the evening of July 3, 2009, six agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation met Mr. Aleynikov as he landed at Newark International airport and arrested him.

Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual United States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him under home confinement and electronic monitoring until his sentencing, which is set for March 18.

A version of this article appears in print on Dec. 11, 2010, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: Wall St. Programmer Guilty of Code Theft.

 United States Attorney Southern District of New York 
 
 Manhattan U.S. Attorney PREET BHARARA said: "Protecting the proprietary information of America’s companies is critically important. Today’s sentence sends a clear message that professionals like Sergey Aleynikov who abuse their positions of trust to steal confidential business information from their employers will be prosecuted and punished."

Under USC 18.225.each person:

'...imprisoned for a term of not less than 10 years and which may be life."

i am unfamiliar with any internet based spy tools, other than mobi-stealth, which was helpful in the past. other than that one, i don’t know about any other spy tools other than what is used by the federal government.

 In fact, SPAM only contains six ingredients! And the brand's website lists them all. They are: pork with ham meat added (that counts as one), salt, water, potato starch, sugar, and sodium nitrite.
